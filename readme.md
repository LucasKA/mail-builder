# MailBuilder.io

This is an amalgamation of [Grunt-Email-Workflow](https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow) for building emails, combined with the awesome [responsive layout system from Ink](https://github.com/zurb/ink)

DOCS FROM ORIGINAL REPO MOVED TO WIKI

# TODO

- Get the current version running without command line stuff
- Set up a better interface using react
- Start working on the Data model with Firebase
- Can we do this without the RUBY gem (Perhaps using the Premailer API)
